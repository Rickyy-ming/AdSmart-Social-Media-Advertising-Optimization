# AdSmart-Social-Media-Advertising-Optimization

**AdSmart** is a data-driven project aimed at optimizing social media advertising strategies for Aura Align, a company looking to maximize the impact of its campaigns across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Twitter. This project combines data analytics, optimization techniques, and machine learning to achieve targeted advertising goals under defined constraints.

## Overview

With social media becoming a key channel for marketing, this project addresses the challenges of effective budget allocation and campaign optimization. Using a Kaggle dataset of social media advertising metrics, we designed a solution to:
1. Maximize conversion rates across campaigns.
2. Minimize advertising costs.
3. Maximize Return on Investment (ROI).

## Key Features

1. **Optimization Framework**:
   - Allocates budgets across platforms to maximize key metrics (conversion rates, ROI).
   - Incorporates constraints like location, language, audience demographics, and engagement thresholds.

2. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Leverages metrics like ad impressions, clicks, and demographic data to build actionable insights.
   - Provides recommendations on platform-specific strategies for better performance.

3. **Customizable Constraints**:
   - Ensures that advertising adheres to business rules such as regional targeting, gender distribution, and budget caps.
